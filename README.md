# custom_voice_recorder
This is a simple custom voice recorder that is set to record 5-second clips and then save it in the recordings folder as well as create a spectrogram (image) of that voice and save it in another folder named spectrograms (both files will have the same name.).
You can change the code to rename the folder names or the file names or the bit rate of the audio or the time range. There are comments beside the code to help understand it.
## Install:
1. download the 'voice recorder.py' file
2. use 'pip install pyaudio' and 'pip install matplotlib' in cmd
3. run the code in ide like visual studio
